# Project-2: Room and Bored 

## Problem 
As A busy college student living in a dorm room 
I WANT to be able to easily communicate with others within my 
dormitory to be informed of updates and activities 
going on in my community 
SO THAT I can be aware of whats going on around me 


## Solution
Create an application that alllows students to communicate within
an online board consisting of their dormmates. 
User application will
run within a DATABASE thru MySQl and include Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap, Handlebars and be deployed on Heroku


## How to Use This Application 
User must first input data to create an ID for the Community Board 
THEN user can post any news, updates or information they would like 
to share AND user can keep up with posts created by others within their living community..simple as that!


## Deployed Application 
Heroku: https://dorm-forum.herokuapp.com/
Github:
